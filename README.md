### About

This is my toy path tracer I work on in my free time.

It is exposed as a Hydra render delegate and comes with a standalone that accepts [Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/intro.html) (USD) files. It is cross-platform, GPU-accelerated, and supports [MaterialX](https://www.materialx.org/index.html), [MDL](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/material-definition-language/) and [UsdPreviewSurface](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/spec_usdpreviewsurface.html) materials.

Technically, gatling uses the MDL code generation backend of the MaterialX project to support and importance-sample complex BSDFs like the Autodesk Standard Surface or the glTF shading model. The MDL SDK then generates GLSL code which is compiled to SPIR-V for use in [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/). A compressed 8-wide BVH is used to speed up rendering, but hardware ray tracing will be used in the future.

### Build

You need to

- install the <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/">Vulkan SDK</a>
- download the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-mdl-sdk-get-started">MDL SDK 2022.0</a> binaries
- build <a href="https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/releases/tag/v22.08">USD 22.08</a> with MaterialX support
- have NASM 2.13+ or YASM 1.2.0+ in your PATH

> Note: EXR export requires building USD with OpenImageIO support.

Do a recursive clone of the repository and set up a build folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/pablode/gatling --recursive
mkdir gatling/build && cd gatling/build
```

Pass following parameters in the CMake generation phase:
```
cmake .. -Wno-dev \
         -DUSD_ROOT=<USD_INSTALL_DIR> \
         -DMDL_ROOT=<MDL_INSTALL_DIR> \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<USD_INSTALL_DIR>/plugin/usd
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

> Note: If you're using MSVC, be sure to select a 64-bit generator.

Build the relevant targets and install the Hydra delegate to the USD plugin folder:
```
cmake --build . -j8 --target hdGatling gatling --config Release
cmake --install . --component hdGatling
```

### Usage

Gatling can be used by every application which supports Hydra, either natively or through a plugin.

</p>

A headless standalone is provided that accepts a USD file (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) as input. Make sure that there is a polygonal light source in the scene.

```
./bin/gatling <scene.usd> render.png \
    --image-width 1200 \
    --image-height 1200 \
    --spp 1024 \
    --max-bounces 8
```

> Note: Disable the system's GPU watchdog or set an appropriate timeout value.

### Outlook

Work in progress: texture support, material network patching, NEE/MIS.
